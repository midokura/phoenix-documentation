This is provided to operators as the entry point to the provisioning procedure leading to a fully operational Phoenix cluster.\n\nThis version is installed in our QA/Staging cluster.\n\nCheers.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## Operator reference\n\nThis is the reference sheet for Phoenix v1.0, an end-to-end solution to operate private,\nmulti-tenant AI factories. Operators will find below an overview of the materials, infrastructure, and other requirements, and an entry point to the procedure to provision and configure the system.\n\nPlease contact support@midokura.com for more information.\n\n## System requirements\n\nNote: documentation files referenced here are provided in a downloadable artefact included in the environment setup section.\n\n- Before proceeding, operators are expected to ensure that the underlying infrastructure\nmeets the system requirements listed below.\n- Operating system requirements for the OpenStack control nodes are available in the\ndocumentation file ./service-operator/OS_REQUIREMENTS.md\n- Operators are expected to set up their hardware according to our official Blueprint,\nspecifically with regard to network configuration, port and interface assignment.\n    - Base Operating System for OSt controllers should be ubuntu-24.04\n- Storage. Operators are expected to provide a Ceph cluster, integrated in the\ninfrastructure as defined in the blueprint. See more details in the Environment setup.\n- Set up a new Google Application that will be used as an SSO provider for the IaaS\nservice. To follow this process, consult the\n./service-operator/GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md file in the documentation bundle\ndescribed below.\n- Set up credentials for the private registry at ghcr.io/midokura. We will provide you\nwith this token via secure means, and it will be required during the control plane\ninstallation process (more info ./service-operator/GHCR_AUTHENTICATION.md).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe sections below provide references to materials required to proceed with the provisioning process, which takes place from the Bastion node shown in the blueprint. On a high level, the process is based on:\n- An installer of the network fabric controller.\n- A bundle of Ansible playbooks that will install and configure all components in the control plane.\n\n## Environment setup\n\nTo install the Phoenix cluster, the Operator will work from the bastion node reflected in the blueprint. The materials below must be available in the node before proceeding with the installation.\n\n1. Create a new directory ./phoenix. This will serve to store artefacts and playbooks. All\ncommands and paths in this document are relative to this directory.\n2. Download and extract the Documentation bundle.
