### Router host and Service VM provisioning automation

The provisioning and managing of service VMs hosted on the "router host" infrastructure have been automated and configured as code. This brings auditable changes, reproducibility and testing to a piece of infra manually managed before. Once the router host OS and Access Router VM are manually prepared and brought on-site, all subsequent steps — including bastion VM setup, HedgeHog controller deployment, Access Router configuration (WireGuard VPN, DHCP/DNS, PXE/TFTP), and network fabric bootstrapping in HedgeHog — are fully automated via Ansible. The only manual steps remaining are one-time hardware setup and the initial OS/VM image preparation, which by nature must be done offline before the unit is deployed to the datacenter.
