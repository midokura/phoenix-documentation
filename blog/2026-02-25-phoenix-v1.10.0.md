### GPU Direct RDMA and RoCEv2 Support

This release validates and enables end-to-end GPU Direct RDMA over RoCEv2 for bare metal GPU servers. The network fabric and bare metal hardware are now verified to be correctly configured for lossless Ethernet (Priority Flow Control, DSCP/TC marking) as required by RoCEv2. The CUDA image has been updated to support GPU Direct RDMA using either NCCL or rdma-cm on Mellanox ConnectX-6 (or later) NICs, leveraging the modern DMA-BUF kernel path rather than the legacy nvidia-peermem approach. Operators and users can validate the full RDMA stack using the new verification scripts now shipped with the image.

For more details, see the [GPU Server Verification guide](../docs/user/GPU_SERVER_VERIFICATION).
