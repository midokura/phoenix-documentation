# Kubernetes Clusters
Provisioning Kubernetes Clusters

This guide explains how to provision and manage Kubernetes clusters from
the Console UI.

## Navigation

Click **Clusters** in the left sidebar to open the clusters management page.

## Creating a Cluster

1. Click **Create Cluster** (top-right of the clusters panel).
2. Fill in the form:

   | Field | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **Name** | A name for your cluster. Auto-generated by default — you can leave it or customize it. |
   | **Cluster Type** | Select one of three types (see below). |
   | **Number of Nodes** | How many worker nodes to provision. Use the quick-select buttons (1, 4, 8, 32) or enter a custom value. |

3. Click **Create**. The cluster will appear in the table with status **CREATING**.

### Cluster Types

| Type | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Barebones** | General-purpose Kubernetes. Supports GPU nodes. |

## Cluster Lifecycle

After creation, the cluster progresses through these states:

```
CREATING → BOOTSTRAPPING → READY_CONTROL_PLANE → ADDING_WORKERS → ACTIVE
```

The table refreshes automatically. Once the status shows **ACTIVE**, the cluster is ready to use.

If something goes wrong, the status changes to **ERROR**.

## Viewing Cluster Details

Click the **details icon** on any row to open the cluster details panel. It shows:

- Status, type, creation and update timestamps
- Expected node count and health status
- Kubernetes version, container runtime, network plugin, and cloud provider
- Per-node health status (expandable)
- Instructions for downloading and using the kubeconfig

---

## Downloading the Kubeconfig

The kubeconfig is only available when the cluster status is **ACTIVE**.

- From the **clusters table**: click the **download icon** on the cluster row.
- From the **cluster details panel**: click **Download kubeconfig**.

The downloaded file contains an embedded client certificate and CA certificate. Store it securely — it grants full access to your cluster.

To use it with `kubectl`:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/downloaded-kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get nodes
```

**Note:** Kubernetes clusters are only accesible from the tenant VPN
network. Please refer to the VPN Credentials guide for instructions on
connecting to the VPN.

## Deleting a Cluster

1. Click the **delete icon** on the cluster row.
2. Confirm the deletion in the dialog.

The cluster status changes to **DELETING** and the row is removed once the deletion completes. This action is irreversible.

> **Note:** The delete button is disabled while a cluster is already in the **DELETING** state.
