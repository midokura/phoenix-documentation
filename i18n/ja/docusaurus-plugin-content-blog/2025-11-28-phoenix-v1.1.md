## Operator reference

This is the reference sheet for Phoenix v1.1, an end-to-end solution to operate private,
multi-tenant AI factories. Operators will find below an overview of the materials, infrastructure,
and other requirements, and an entry point to the procedure to provision and configure the
system.

Please contact support@midokura.com for more information.

## System requirements

Note: documentation files referenced here are provided in a downloadable artefact included in the environment setup section.
- Before proceeding, operators are expected to ensure that the underlying infrastructure
meets the system requirements listed below.
- Operating system requirements for the OpenStack control nodes are available in the
documentation file ./service-operator/OS_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Operators are expected to set up their hardware according to our official Blueprint,
specifically with regard to network configuration, port and interface assignment.
  - Base Operating System for OSt controllers should be ubuntu-24.04
- Storage. Operators are expected to provide a Ceph cluster, integrated in the
infrastructure as defined in the blueprint. See more details in the Environment setup.
- Set up a new Google Application that will be used as an SSO provider for the IaaS
service. To follow this process, consult the
./service-operator/GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md file in the documentation bundle
described below.
- Set up credentials for the private registry at ghcr.io/midokura. We will provide you
with this token via secure means, and it will be required during the control plane
installation process (more info ./service-operator/GHCR_AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Overview

The sections below provide references to materials required to proceed with the provisioning
process, which takes place from the Bastion node shown in the blueprint. On a high level, the
process is based on:
- An installer of the network fabric controller.
- A bundle of Ansible playbooks that will install and configure all components in the control plane.

## Environment setup

To install the Phoenix cluster, the Operator will work from the bastion node reflected in the blueprint. The materials below must be available in the node before proceeding with the
installation.

1. Create a new directory ./phoenix. This will serve to store artefacts and playbooks. All
commands and paths in this document are relative to this directory.
1. Download and extract the Documentation bundle. We will refer to documentation files
from different sections of this document.
1. Download the Network controller installer ISO
    - Hedgehog-installer.iso
  
## Provisioning procedure

### Network fabric setup

- To install the network fabric controller, follow the instructions in
./service-operator/NETWORK_CONTROL_NODE_SETUP.md
Control plane installation
- Prepare the Ceph cluster by following the steps explained in the documentation file
./service-operator/CEPH_SETUP.md.
- Download and extract Ansible playbooks.
- Download inventory.example.yml as the base to input the configuration specific to your
cluster.
- Execute them following instructions in ./service-operator/DEPLOYMENT.md

### IaaS Console - Tenant and User configuration

To create additional admin users, register tenants and tenant users, please refer to the
instructions in ./service-operator/IAAS_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION.md

### Baremetal Installation

To install a baremetal node, please refer to the instructions in the documentation file:
./service-operator/INSTALL_BAREMETAL_NODE.md
