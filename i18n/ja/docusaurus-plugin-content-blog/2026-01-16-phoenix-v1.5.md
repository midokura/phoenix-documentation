## Features

### Kubernetes Cluster Management Enhancements

#### Download Cluster Configuration Files

- Users can now download kubeconfig files directly from the UI for active
Kubernetes clusters
- This enables immediate access to clusters using standard Kubernetes tools like
kubectl
- The download button appears in the cluster details view for ready clusters

#### Improved Cluster Information Display

- Enhanced cluster details page with more comprehensive information:
    - Cluster Health Status: Visual indicators showing whether clusters are
healthy, unhealthy, or in an unknown state
    - Detailed Cluster Labels: Displays Kubernetes version, container runtime,
network plugin, and cloud provider information
    - Node Health Details: Expandable view showing health status for individual
cluster nodes
    - Updated Timestamps: Shows both creation and last update dates
- Clusters table now shows master count instead of creation date for better
at-a-glance information

#### Configurable Cluster Settings

- System administrators can now configure cluster templates and settings through
configuration files
- No longer requires code changes to adjust cluster creation parameters
- More flexible deployment options for different environments

### Security Improvements

SSH Key Validation

- The system now validates SSH public keys when users add them
- Invalid or malformed keys are rejected with clear error messages
- Prevents issues that could occur later when using keys for server access

### Infrastructure Automation

#### Enhanced Compute Infrastructure

- Support for compute-only nodes, enabling more flexible infrastructure scaling
- Better integration between IaaS Console and Kubernetes cluster management
(Magnum)

#### Improved Deployment Experience

- Deployment scripts now work from any directory, making setup easier
- More consistent inventory management across the platform

### Bug Fixes

#### Application Fixes

- Fixed an issue with OpenStack client operations that could affect multi-tenant
environments
- Improved reliability of cluster and infrastructure operations

#### Infrastructure Reliability Fixes

- Memory Leak Fix: Resolved memory leak in OpenStack networking that required
daily restarts
- Boot Configuration: Fixed GRUB update issues that could prevent servers from
booting correctly
- Hostname Resolution: Fixed hostname resolution problems that were affecting
various services
- Virtual Machine Issues: Resolved KVM VM hostname resolution problems
- System Configuration: Fixed formatting issues in system configuration files

#### Configuration Fixes

- Fixed image download and storage configuration issues
- Corrected Magnum network driver configuration
- Fixed CoreDNS Kubernetes external service configuration

### Performance & Reliability

- Faster application startup - Grafana integration no longer blocks the application from starting
- More reliable cluster operations with improved timeout handling
- Better error handling and retry logic for infrastructure operations

## Operator reference

This is the reference sheet for Phoenix v1.5, an end-to-end solution to operate private,
multi-tenant AI factories. Operators will find below an overview of the materials, infrastructure,
and other requirements, and an entry point to the procedure to provision and configure the
system.

Please contact support@midokura.com for more information.

### System requirements

Note: documentation files referenced here are provided in a downloadable artefact included in
the environment setup section.

- Before proceeding, operators are expected to ensure that the underlying infrastructure
meets the system requirements listed below.
- Operating system requirements for the OpenStack control nodes are available in the
documentation file ./service-operator/OS_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Operators are expected to set up their hardware according to our official Blueprint,
specifically with regard to network configuration, port and interface assignment.
    - Base Operating System for OSt controllers should be ubuntu-24.04
- Storage. Operators are expected to provide a Ceph cluster, integrated in the
infrastructure as defined in the blueprint. See more details in the Environment setup.
- Set up a new Google Application that will be used as an SSO provider for the IaaS
service. To follow this process, consult the ./service-operator/GOOGLE_SSO_SETUP.md file in the documentation bundle described below.
- Set up credentials for the private registry at ghcr.io/midokura. We will provide you
with this token via secure means, and it will be required during the control plane
installation process (more info ./service-operator/GHCR_AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Overview

The sections below provide references to materials required to proceed with the provisioning
process, which takes place from the Bastion node shown in the blueprint. On a high level, the
process is based on:
- An installer of the network fabric controller.
- A bundle of Ansible playbooks that will install and configure all components in the control
plane.

## Environment setup

To install the Phoenix cluster, the Operator will work from the bastion node reflected in the
blueprint. The materials below must be available in the node before proceeding with the
installation.

1. Create a new directory ./phoenix. This will serve to store artefacts and playbooks. All
commands and paths in this document are relative to this directory.
1. Download and extract the Documentation bundle. We will refer to documentation files from different sections of this document.
1. Download the Network controller installer ISO and the network fabric configuration
    - hedgehog-installer.iso
    - hedgehog-fabric-configuration.yaml

## Provisioning procedure

### Network fabric setup

- To install the network fabric controller, follow the instructions in ./service-operator/NETWORK_CONTROL_NODE_SETUP.md

### Control plane installation

- Prepare the Ceph cluster by following the steps explained in the documentation file ./service-operator/CEPH_SETUP.md.
- Download and extract Ansible playbooks.
- Download inventory.example.yml as the base to input the configuration specific to your cluster.
- Execute them following the instructions in ./service-operator/DEPLOYMENT.md

### IaaS Console - Tenant and User configuration

To create additional admin users, register tenants and tenant users, please refer to the
instructions in ./service-operator/IAAS_CONSOLE_CONFIGURATION.md

### Baremetal Installation

To install a baremetal node, please refer to the instructions in the documentation file:
./service-operator/INSTALL_BAREMETAL_NODE.md
